## üÜï Claude Skills (Released October 16, 2025)

### What Are Claude Skills?

<cite index="3-1,3-2,3-3">Claude can now use Skills to improve how it performs specific tasks. Skills are folders that include instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude can load when needed. Claude will only access a skill when it's relevant to the task at hand.</cite>

**Think of Skills as:** <cite index="3-27">Custom onboarding materials that let you package expertise, making Claude a specialist on what matters most to you.</cite>

### How Skills Work

<cite index="4-16">Skills are conceptually extremely simple: a skill is a Markdown file telling the model how to do something, optionally accompanied by extra documents and pre-written scripts that the model can run to help it accomplish the tasks described by the skill.</cite>

**Structure:**
```
my-skill/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md           ‚Üê Instructions for Claude
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/         ‚Üê Optional files/data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/           ‚Üê Optional executable code
```

<cite index="4-20,4-21">At the start of a session Claude's various harnesses can scan all available skill files and read a short explanation for each one from the frontmatter YAML in the Markdown file. This is very token efficient: each skill only takes up a few dozen extra tokens, with the full details only loaded in should the user request a task that the skill can help solve.</cite>

### Key Features

<cite index="3-33,3-34,3-35,3-36">Skills are organized folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude loads dynamically to perform specialized tasks. The initial release includes: Anthropic-managed Skills: Pre-built Skills for working with PowerPoint (.pptx), Excel (.xlsx), Word (.docx), and PDF files ¬∑ Custom Skills: Upload your own Skills via the Skills API (/v1/skills endpoints) to package domain expertise and organizational workflows ¬∑ Skills require the code execution tool to be enabled</cite>

**Characteristics:**
- **Composable:** Skills stack together - Claude figures out what's needed
- **Portable:** Works across Claude apps, Claude Code, and API
- **Efficient:** Only loads what's needed, when needed
- **Powerful:** Can include executable code for reliability

### Availability

<cite index="3-29">Skills are available to Pro, Max, Team and Enterprise users.</cite>

### How to Use Skills in cmux (Claude Code)

<cite index="3-4,3-5,3-6,3-7,3-8">Skills extend Claude Code with your team's expertise and workflows. Install skills via plugins from the anthropics/skills marketplace. Claude loads them automatically when relevant. Share skills through version control with your team. You can also manually install skills by adding them to ~/.claude/skills.</cite>

**Installation:**
```bash
# Manual installation
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cd ~/.claude/skills

# Download or create a skill
# Example: Clone from anthropics/skills repo
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/skills

# Claude will auto-discover skills in ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Creating Custom Skills:**
<cite index="3-34">The "skill-creator" skill provides interactive guidance: Claude asks about your workflow, generates the folder structure, formats the SKILL.md file, and bundles the resources you need.</cite>

### Do Skills Apply to cmux? YES! ‚úÖ

**cmux IS Claude Code**, so Skills work here!

**Tomorrow you can:**
1. Install skills to `~/.claude/skills/`
2. Claude (me) will automatically use relevant skills
3. No manual enabling needed - I'll detect and load them

**For your n8n project**, you could create a skill:
```
~/.claude/skills/n8n-workflow-builder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md         ‚Üê Instructions for building n8n workflows
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/        ‚Üê Sample workflow JSON files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/       ‚Üê Common node configurations
```

## üìù cmux Spend Tracking

### Token/Cost Tracking

**In cmux interface:** Look for token count at bottom of chat window or in settings

**No built-in CLI command found** in `~/.cmux/` config

**Workarounds:**
1. Check cmux UI directly (may show token usage)
2. Anthropic Console: https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Shows total API usage
   - Billing dashboard
   - Usage breakdown

3. Check conversation metadata (if available in UI)

**For this conversation:**
- Approximately 165K tokens used
- Mostly context/setup discussion
- Fresh workspace tomorrow will be much more efficient!

## üîß Empty Folders & Config Files - Why Keep Them?

### Empty Folders (notes/, processed/, backups/)

**YES, keep them!** ‚úÖ

**Why:**
1. **docker-compose.yml references them** as volume mounts
2. **Workflows expect them** to exist
3. **Git needs placeholders** to track empty directories
4. **Prevents errors** when n8n tries to access them

**Without these folders:**
```bash
docker compose up -d
# ERROR: Mount path does not exist: /notes
```

**Best practice:**
Add `.gitkeep` files to keep folders in git:
```bash
touch notes/.gitkeep
touch processed/.gitkeep
touch backups/.gitkeep
```

### Config Files (.yml, .sh)

**YES, absolutely keep!** ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ

**docker-compose.yml:**
- ‚úÖ **CRITICAL** - This IS your n8n installation
- ‚úÖ Defines n8n container configuration
- ‚úÖ Volume mappings (where your data goes)
- ‚úÖ Environment variables
- ‚úÖ Port mappings (5678)
- ‚ùå Delete this = n8n won't work!

**quick-start.sh:**
- ‚úÖ Convenience script for starting n8n
- ‚úÖ Checks Docker is running
- ‚úÖ Creates directories
- ‚úÖ Shows helpful messages
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional but very useful

**.env:**
- ‚úÖ **IMPORTANT** - Your configuration
- ‚úÖ Passwords, settings
- ‚úÖ Should NOT be in git (already in .gitignore)
- ‚ùå Delete = lose your password/config

**.env.example:**
- ‚úÖ Template for others
- ‚úÖ Safe to commit (no secrets)
- ‚úÖ Documentation of what's needed

**.gitignore:**
- ‚úÖ Protects secrets
- ‚úÖ Prevents committing .env
- ‚úÖ Ignores generated files
- ‚úÖ CRITICAL for security

**Summary:** All these files serve important purposes! Don't delete any of them.

---

## üì¶ What CAN You Delete/Archive?

### Safe to Archive/Delete:

‚úÖ **old-files/** (already archived)
- Goat.txt
- readme.txt (old)
- Old documentation

‚úÖ **Nothing else!** Everything in root serves a purpose:
- Config files: Critical for n8n
- Folders: Expected by docker-compose
- docs/: Your knowledge base
- workflows/: Importable workflows

### If You Want to Clean Up:

**Option 1: Hide from view (not delete):**
```bash
# These folders will be empty until you use them
# That's OK! Docker creates them as needed
notes/       # Will fill with your notes
processed/   # Will fill with outputs
backups/     # Will fill with backups
```

**Option 2: Add .gitkeep:**
```bash
echo "# Placeholder" > notes/.gitkeep
echo "# Placeholder" > processed/.gitkeep
echo "# Placeholder" > backups/.gitkeep
```

Now git tracks the folders even when empty!

1. **Install n8n Chat Extension:**
   - Chrome Web Store
   - Search "n8n Chat"
   - Works with your self-hosted instance!
   - Gives you the AI sidebar you wanted! ‚úÖ

2. **Optional: Create Claude Skill:**

   mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/apple-notes-workflow
   # Copy your workflow docs there
   # I'll auto-use it tomorrow!
   ```

3. **Keep using cmux:**
   - Best for complex planning
   - Can use Skills
   - Free (no API costs)
   - Works offline

### File Organization:

‚úÖ **Keep:** All .yml, .sh, and config files (critical!)
‚úÖ **Keep:** Empty folders (Docker needs them)
‚úÖ **Archive:** Silly files like Goat.txt (already done!)
‚úÖ **Current structure is perfect!**

**Ideal setup:**
```
1. Start n8n: docker compose up -d
2. Open Chrome ‚Üí http://localhost:5678
3. n8n Chat extension = AI sidebar ‚úÖ
