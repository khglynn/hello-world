## Key Patterns:

### UNIVERSAL AGREEMENT - Vote YES:
- **Prop 4** (Water Fund) - Everyone agrees Texas needs water infrastructure
- **Prop 7** (Veteran Spouses) - Helping Gold Star families
- **Prop 10** (Fire Relief) - Common-sense disaster relief
- **Prop 11, 13** (Homestead Exemptions) - Broad-based tax relief

### UNIVERSAL AGREEMENT - Vote NO:
- **Props 2, 6, 8** (Tax Bans) - "Tying future legislature's hands"
- **Props 15, 16, 17** (Culture War Props) - Performative/unnecessary
- **Prop 9** (Business Equipment) - Corporate giveaway

### THE SPLITS:
- **Prop 1** (Tech College): Progressive split on permanent constitutional funding vs. workforce training value
- **Prop 3** (Bail): Criminal justice reform divide (conservative papers YES, progressive NO)
- **Prop 5** (Animal Feed): Only SA Express-News says YES (helps agriculture)
- **Prop 14** (Dementia): Austin Chronicle stands alone saying NO (government overreach), everyone else YES

## Detailed Explanations:

### Props 2, 6, 8 - The "Pre-Emptive Tax Ban" Trio:
These ban taxes that don't currently exist in Texas.

**Reasoning for NO:** Prevents future elected officials from using these revenue tools if Texas faces fiscal crisis

**Houston Chronicle:** "shortsighted to prevent future lawmakers from considering policies"

### Prop 14 - The Dementia Research Split:
- **YES camp:** Good investment, like cancer research fund, attracts researchers
- **NO camp (Austin Chronicle only):** Government shouldn't pick winners, could fund through normal budget

### Prop 15 - Parental Rights:
- Already enshrined in law; critics see this as targeting LGBTQ families
- **SA Express-News:** "fails to acknowledge that children also have rights"

### Prop 16 - Citizenship Voting:
- Already illegal for non-citizens to vote
- **SA Express-News:** "we doubt this proposition is offered in good faith"
