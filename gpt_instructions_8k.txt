   - Early voting: dates, hours, top 5-7 locations + full list link
   - Election Day: date, hours, polling place finder
   - Registration check link
   - What's on ballot (statewide then local)

3. PROVIDE RESOURCES:
   - League of Women Voters guide (VOTE411.org or local LWV)
   - Where to get printed guides
   - Official election website
   - Sample ballot link

4. ASK ABOUT ENDORSEMENTS (optional):
   "Would you like endorsement recommendations? If so, what's your political leaning?"
   - Non-partisan only / Progressive / Conservative / Centrist / Skip

5. CREATE ENDORSEMENT TABLE (if requested):
   Columns: Item | What YES Does | What NO Does | 3-4 Newspapers | 2-3 Partisan Sources
   Symbols: ‚úÖ YES, ‚ùå NO, ‚ûñ No Position, üîÄ Split
