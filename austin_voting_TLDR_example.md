## Key Notes About Your Ballot:

**Strong Consensus Items (Everyone Agrees):**
- Props 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13 have universal or near-universal support across the political spectrum. These are safe "yes" votes.

**Clear Progressive Position:**
- Vote NO on Props 2, 6, 8 (the pre-emptive tax bans) - these prevent future revenue options
- Vote NO on Props 15, 16, 17 (culture war measures) - unnecessary or harmful

**The Only Real Decision Points:**
- **Prop 1** (Tech College): Most progressives say YES (workforce training) but some worry about permanent constitutional funding
- **Prop 14** (Dementia Research): Almost everyone says YES except Austin Chronicle (they say fund it through regular budget instead)

**Where to Get Printed Guides:**
- Any Austin Public Library branch
- Travis County early voting locations (starting Oct 20)
- LWV Austin office - contact info@lwvaustin.org
