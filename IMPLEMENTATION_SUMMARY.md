## üéì What We Learned

### Research Insights:
1. **Consensus exists:** Many ballot items have near-universal agreement
2. **"Pre-emptive bans" pattern:** TX Props 2, 6, 8 all criticized for same reason
3. **Vote-by-mail confusion:** Many don't know CO/CA/OR are automatic mail ballots
4. **LWV is gold:** Most reliable nonpartisan source across all states
5. **Progressive sources align:** When DSA, WFP, and major papers agree, it's a strong signal

### Technical Learnings:
1. **HTML is ideal for GitHub Pages:** Self-contained, no build process
2. **Sticky table headers:** Great UX for long tables
3. **Color-coding helps:** Each city feels distinct
4. **Plain text matters:** Not everyone can view HTML in texts
